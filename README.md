# RimWorld, Better Terrain

![](https://i.imgur.com/1SzUQXR.png)

Welcome!  
This mod showcases vast and sweeping changes to beautify the terrain of RimWorld colonies.  Each map will showcase multiple different 'mini-biomes' befitting the over-arching biome.  Temperate forests will have areas ranging from dense forests to praries to rocky plains, so on and so forth.
* __Plants:__ Now placed according to the 'mini-biome'.  Forests are dense with trees and bushes; plains have a thick layer of yellowish grass, patches of beautifull flowers and an overall splattering of shrubs.
* __Textures:__ Plants, trees, rocks, ground texture, mountain color... all recrafted for the sake of viewing pleasure.
* __Mountains:__  Now generally fallow the contours of land, tieing them into the overall immersive aesthetic.
* __Layering:__ Trees can now partially block out the view of rocks, people and animals; preventing the jarring appearance of them floating.
* __Harmony:__ Built using Andreas Pardeike's beautifull Harmony, allowing compatibility in all but fringe cases.
